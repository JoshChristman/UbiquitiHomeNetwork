## üìÑ Project Overview

This advanced home networking project utilizes a **UniFi Gateway Max**, **Switch Ultra 60W**, **U6 Plus AP**, and **two 5G Turret Ultra cameras** to build a secure, high-performance network optimized for both home and small office needs. Five VLANs‚Äî**Nights_Watch** for security cameras, **Pings_Landing** for guest access, **WiFi_Walkers** for IoT devices, **Wildlings_Net** for kids and family, and **The_Mad_Ping** for admin and personal devices‚Äîensure organized traffic management, enhanced security, and dedicated SSIDs for each network segment.

Integrated **IDS/IPS** offers real-time monitoring and threat prevention, while **PoE** on the **Switch Ultra 60W** supports efficient device power management. The cameras provide high-resolution video feeds, and the network‚Äôs configuration, along with this documentation, will be made publicly available to showcase expertise in network setup, security, and documentation.
