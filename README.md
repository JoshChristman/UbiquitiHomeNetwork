# üè† Ubiquiti Home Network Project

## üìå Overview
This project documents the setup of a **secure and high-performance home network** using **Ubiquiti UniFi** hardware. The network is segmented using VLANs for optimized security and performance, with IDS/IPS enabled. The setup also integrates **a NAS for media storage**, **security cameras**, and **a guest network with a captive portal**.

## üì∏ Installed Networking Hardware
The following image showcases the installed networking hardware, including **Starlink, UniFi Cloud Gateway Max, Switch Ultra 60W, Surge Protector, and U6 Plus AP**:

## üî• Firewall Rules
This network enforces **strict firewall rules** to ensure security and VLAN segmentation.

### ‚ùå Block Rules
- **Block Inter-VLAN Traffic** (except for specific allow rules)
- **Block Nights_Watch (Cameras) from Internet & VLANs**
- **Block Guest VLAN from accessing internal networks**
- **Block IoT VLAN (WiFi_Walkers) from internal networks except NAS (10.25.1.10)**
- **Block Unauthorized Traffic**

### ‚úÖ Allow Rules
- **Allow The_Mad_Ping (Admin) to All VLANs**
- **Allow Wildlings_Net to WiFi_Walkers** (but **not** The_Mad_Ping)
- **Allow Guest VLAN to Internet (Captive Portal Authentication Required)**
- **Allow IoT VLAN to access NAS (10.25.1.10) on media ports only**
- **Allow VPN to access specific VLANs (Admin, Home Lab)**
